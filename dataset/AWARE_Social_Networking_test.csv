But for me the most valuable thing about Discord is the sense of community that you feel almost immediately after logging on.

I deserve a right to privacy, as does everyone else, and it’s too loud for that to be an option. Other people can hear my conversations and it’s very bothersome. I miss having the option between the two. Don’t fix something that isn’t broken please! Otherwise, there’s this constant bug with webcams/ turning on your camera. sometimes it never loads and you have to turn it off and on to get it to work properly. I’ve had to do this up to 3 times maximum to get it to work finally, which is nothing at first, but becomes annoying. Finally, (most likely not 100% discord’s fault, you can ignore this if you want) the connection seems to be getting worse. I used to love discord for the quality of the calls, but several times a week the quality becomes so bad that I have to restart the call several times to understand a sentence the recipient. The most common connection issue is definitely the that audio seems to skip out entirely for a few seconds sometimes. I understand that this could also be due to my own connection and the recipient’s connection, so take this with a grain of salt. Considering that, many times before there has been nothing wrong with our internet and this still happens.","I deserve a right to privacy, as does everyone else, and it’s too loud for that to be an option.",3,True,security,privacy,22.0,29.0,negative,"I deserve a right to $T$, as does everyone else, and it’s too loud for that to be an option.","I deserve a right to $T$, as does everyone else, and it’s too loud for that to be an option.

But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!

I kept getting disconnected/reconnected and other people’s voices were going robotic due to that, the app kept crashing, and now, I was getting kicked from the voice channels entirely.Today it’s gotten worse, many other people and I have gotten a bug where we can’t hear anything going on in the voice channel.

But for me the most valuable thing about Discord is the sense of community that you feel almost immediately after logging on.

One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.","Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.",4,True,general,audio,97.0,102.0,positive,"Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up $T$ after.","Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up $T$ after.

My only problem is now Ive got it on my call history (which is rather annoying), and its taking over as an actual call rather than an in-app feature. In my opinion, discord made a poor choice, and possibly giving the people a function to disable the callkit will allow discord to be more functional for its users. I personally disprove of this update, as every time someone actually calls me outside of the discord app, I have to end my own discord call instwad of it holding in the background after I finish speaking with whomever called me.To the creators of discord, I highly suggest you either 1. Remove callkit completely, or 2. Give us a setting option to turn it off, so that we have private calling, and so it DOES NOT DISPLAY ON MY LOCK SCREEN, (its irritating.)If those changes dont happen, I feel discord will lose quite a bit of its users and people will start to have a slight change its its direction of functioning better and heading on the right path.","Give us a setting option to turn it off, so that we have private calling, and so it DOES NOT DISPLAY ON MY LOCK SCREEN, (its irritating.)",1,True,effectiveness,setting,11.0,18.0,negative,"Give us a $T$ option to turn it off, so that we have private calling, and so it DOES NOT DISPLAY ON MY LOCK SCREEN, (its irritating.)","Give us a $T$ option to turn it off, so that we have private calling, and so it DOES NOT DISPLAY ON MY LOCK SCREEN, (its irritating.)

I have a suggestion, however. I think that WhatsApp should have a function that automatically changes your about according to your location and the time.

When you get there, it says “At the gym”. This is a suggestion I have that I believe will make WhatsApp even better than it already is. I hope y’all take this into consideration.

Telling someone to leave the group and make their own, no one should have to leave their own with friends because one person is being toxic and owners/administrators aren’t doing their jobs or don’t care or have A neutral personalities typically. The only platform that have recorded voice chat are Sony Party Chat on console and MS Chat. This feature needs to be added to discord platform or ban whole platform from all countries.

Over the last several years Facebook has become increasingly totalitarian. I can’t even scroll through my news feed without every other post having a flag on it because Facebook’s “independent fact checkers” have deemed it “false information”. Facebook has zero respect for free speech. The only thing worse than Facebook’s “independent fact checkers” is their gross invasion of users privacy. They track your exact location, your website history, and they use the microphone on your phone to record everything that you say. This happens every second your phone is on, regardless of if the app is opened or closed. What do they do with all of this information? They sell it to other companies for a profit, they use it to bombard you with ads that are very specific to you, and God knows what else. Mark Zuckerburg has become filthy rich off of invading the privacy of over 3 billion people and selling off that information.

But having the option to fix typos and misspellings is so key.3. Chat color choices - offer more than just light green bubble choices. Offer a wide range of colors (including gradients) as a fun feature that allows for customization. 4. Reactions - allow a set of reactions to messages including heart, thumbs up and down, and possibly some basic emojis. This makes communication much more efficient.I hope the developers will seriously consider adding all of these features!

It does an amazing job at keeping notifications hidden when you want them to be.But I cannot say the same for calls. Recently, Discord started integrating their calls with actual phone calls. This means that every time I get called on Discord, it goes through to my ringtone. The whole reason I use Discord is to keep my online life separate from my personal life. Although there is a setting that allows you to disable this feature, I still get the ringtone. Whenever I get called on Discord, even though the app is closed, I still get a ringtone. I even have all notifications turned off in my settings.

The previous update had the setting that disabled the integrated phone calls, but it actually did its job, unlike this recent update. I had no calls going through no matter how much I was getting spammed with calls. I thought this problem would be gone forever, but it still managed to find its way back.

The ""Autodownload photos/videos"" feature on the iPhone has a severely annoying feature in group chats. While I want things downloaded, I DO NOT WANT THEM ADDED TO MY PHOTO LIBRARY. The reason why is that I was in a large public group, and a spammer joined an started posting porn. This was auto-downloaded, added to my photo library, and then auto-transferred to another photo library. As a result, a spammer ended up adding a bunch of porn to my photo library, which was then uploaded to a second backup, and almost ended up with it uploaded to social media. I had to spend hours clearing multiple libraries of this crap, and I still cannot be 100% sure I got everything. To be clear, I want to be able to see images that the group posts, and I want to be able to download and add them AT WILL.

I did everything as I was told: I sent in a review request and they fixed the problem, unflagging my ads account, so they sent me an email to confirm that all was well again. However, I cannot access either my account or my page anymore. It’s as if they don’t exist. Apparently the problem was already fixed but I can’t see anything I previously put on my account and page.Furthermore, I can’t make a new account because my email is tied to my previous account, so I’m pretty much stuck.

Though having to buy the classic nitro just for chat perks and a gif profile picture for $5 isn’t worth it. Most people buy it for one feature.

Facebook deletes content, “fact-checks” content or puts you in “jail” for your opinion. Time to move on to Parler! At least there you can speak your mind, no matter your opinion, and others are free to agree or disagree without a stupid “false info” notice. Another thing.... I’ve shared so many articles straight from the CDC, WHO, Times and more- if it doesn’t agree with Facebook leaders opinions it automatically gets posted as “false or misleading”. Annoying and at this point it’s funny.

I updated the app and was able to easily stream again one more time last week. This week though, the app once again says “screen share coming soon to iPad” when it had worked fine. This time though, there’s not an update so that must not be the issue.

I have to restart the app every time I change my pfp.The stream audio quality on mobile periodically worsens until words are unintelligible before fixing itself. Exiting and rejoining both the stream and call don’t fix this chronic issue.I also have issues during calls where I can’t hear the person I’m calling and vice versa. Discord has also kicked both of us from the call before but still shown each other as in the call. (aka each person sees themselves and the other in the call, when in reality both have been kicked and do not know it)The biggest pain is that the app overall is has become laggier. The lag has worsened since the UI change adding the gift button and send button animation from a while ago. Simple tasks like sending messages, getting the interface to show so I can unmute while watching someone’s stream, are a chore since I have to wait so long for Discord to do it’s thing. (5+ seconds. This may not sound like much but time it using a timer and imagine waiting that long for every process to load while you’re in a call)Lastly, Discord also seems to be battery hungry. When I join calls my phone becomes burning hot and the battery percentage drops very quickly. I don’t seem to have this issue with zoom.Thanks for reading.

However, recently with the new updates, I’ve noticed quality in calls drop. Granted, the calls were never super great for me, but unlike before, it would consistently mute my friends so that I would have to leave and rejoin, then it’d work. Not only that, but my friends would often cut out several times during call. It could be a network issue and I’m sure this isn’t 100% discord’s fault, however it’s been frequent and annoying at times. Another issue I’ve been experiencing is really annoying. For some reason, discord has completely stopped working at random intervals. What I mean is that even though I get notifications, when I try to launch the app, the loading glitches and I’m forced out. The only way to fix this to my knowledge is deleting the app and downloading it again. It is happening more and more frequently and is an issue I’ve experienced ever since the latest updateOther than that, discord is great.

But after the most recent update, I am now almost completely unable to watch video links even if I'm not in a vc call. They won't load most of the time or actually let me watch it at all, but occasionally I can watch them but then there's no sound, even if I turn the volume up. I'm unaware if it's just an IPhone issue (I have the iPhone 11) or if other phones have this issue too.

I get that the voice should stop but after switching apps and coming back or after ending the phone call, the Discord app never recovers and must be restarted, rejoin the room, and then it works...for a while.  Until almost anything else happens.  Worst of all, when my phone falls asleep, so does Discord, sometimes.  It’s unpredictable when I’m just randomly disconnected from Discord.  My friend reported his phone calls not coming through when he’s on a Discord voice channel. Not sure which problem is worse.I’d highly recommend using a different app. Often, my friends and I just use a phone conference call.  And I can send a text message while on a phone call.

Volume sliders on everybody giving me peace of mind on how loud (or quiet) people are being, being able to voice/text mute people that are being abusive in chat, and having multiple text/voice channels is just icing on the cake.I told myself I wouldn’t write a review for Discord till they rolled out with the video call/screenshare update on PC, and they did so here I am. If you’re wanting a reliable, free, all-access VOIP program for your gaming or chatting needs, Discord is for you.

But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!

However after trying 3 separate pictures you get a warning saying You are changing profile pictures to often to come back later. Why do you; DISCORD, care how often I change my profile picture? That is so stupid. Thats like someone telling me; your changing your underwear to often 🤦‍♂️. It’s a simple little picture that most all Discord Users like to change. Why put a limit on how often you can change your personal profile picture? For this reason alone I rated this app 3 stars because thats just downright greedy to be completely honest!!

Some could say that I am just sensitive to that, but I find that even if the volume is very low, the beeping can be quite loud, while I can barely hear the one I am talking to on the line.Again the constant disconnecting could be because we are in 2 different countries or it could be my internet speed.

However, there are some features on PC that you can just not access on mobile.  For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it’s not the channel settings because it’s only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.  However, if I was able to tell if they'd read my message, I'd be able to yell at — er, uh, talk to them about it.","The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.",4,True,effectiveness,read receipt,99.0,111.0,negative,"The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of $T$s for DMs.","The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of $T$s for DMs.

I re-downloaded the app recently because I was joining a clan and they required discord. I got the app and I was still logged into my old account, which was glitched, so I created a new one. I actually had to create that account on my browser because the app didn’t even let me do that. I created my account and tried to login on the app, no success. I’ve re-downloaded the app numerous times since then and still, no success logging in. Luckily, my browser still works and I use that to chat with my clan.

Also, discord is a good way to chat with strangers and meet new people, without giving out your phone number. And as a final touch, discord’s sense of humor is great. It feels like there are no Easter eggs or humor in any software/apps these days, but discord is different: it has a friendly interface, with many features implemented that are funny.

However, there are some things that I think could be tweaked. So I want to start off by addressing the calls. Everything is fine except the speaker. The only time I can use speaker is when the camera is on, meaning I have to have the camera flipping another way to have the person I’m chatting with not see me. If there could be a speaker button for when you’re calling someone without headphones, that’ll be great. The only other thing I can think of, that I’m really hoping gets fixed, is the emotes for group chat. My friends have no problem using it with their phones, but when it comes to iPhones, if I click emojis, they don’t appear. The only way to make it appear is to type out the name. For example, we have an emote of a cat named henk, so when I would want to use it, I’d have to type :henk:. Now we have a lot of emotes and it’s difficult to remember the name of every single one. If there could be a way for iPhone users to use their emotes without having to type it out, it’ll be nice. If there could also be a way for phone users to create emotes through their phones instead of uploading it to their computer that’ll make things a bit more simple.

It’s an easy to understand usage, for me, and simple to join servers. And the ability to create various rooms for various things also is good and creative as it allows for different topics to be shared. However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It’s difficult to get started, and when you’re using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work. Please pay more attention to the mobile version, to make it equal to the laptop version, as it is difficult and a struggle to use.

However, there are some features on PC that you can just not access on mobile.  For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it’s not the channel settings because it’s only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.  However, if I was able to tell if they'd read my message, I'd be able to yell at — er, uh, talk to them about it.","For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.",4,True,security,privacy,31.0,38.0,negative,"For example, you can't change $T$ settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.","For example, you can't change $T$ settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.

I have been 5 or 6 minutes into record when this happens, and it makes me really angry that it just all of the sudden erases.  To fix this issue, can something be done, please, that either pauses the recording so that it can later be resumed, or forces the recording to send immediately upon receiving a call?

One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.","This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app.",4,True,effectiveness,privacy,29.0,36.0,positive,"This is an issue with maybe $T$, but also while you’re using the app.","This is an issue with maybe $T$, but also while you’re using the app.
